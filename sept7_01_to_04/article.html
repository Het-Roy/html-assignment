    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b>
    such as the abacus. Later, Charles Babbage proposed the 
    <u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <strong>first concept 
    of a programmable computer</strong>.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has 
    evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.
    The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, 
    while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>.
    By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal 
    and affordable</em>.

    <h2>Mathematics in Computing</h2>
    A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup>
    Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water.

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by
    Tim Berners-Lee. As he once said:
    <blockquote>
   "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
   Access by everyone regardless of disability is 
   an essential aspect." 
    <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>
